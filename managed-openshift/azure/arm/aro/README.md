## Scripts

All the shell scripts in the nested directory will have to be updated in accordance with the new Cloud Pak version. I will leave them as they are for the time being. Please bear in mind they are non functional at the time of writing.

## Pending work

2) Only PA is configured - refactor remaining services
3) Clean up scripts to remove unneeded logic, such as JQ and custom domains## Pending work
